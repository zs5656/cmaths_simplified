RSA simulation that uses python to encrypt and decrypt simple messages. Also includes barebones factorisation and prime generation programs. There are two ways to work with this:

1. EXE install
- Just click "Releases" -> "v1.0.0" -> Download .exe file and run it. Don't worry, it's not a virus (because i'm not skilled enough to make one), you can check the source code

2. VSCode Install, or in an IDE
- Visual Studio Code
- Python extension in Visual Studio Code
- Git
- Github push and pull extension

Then clone the repository and run the .py files in order to get an output.
This program can do the following things:

- Generate a series of prime numbers from a range of numbers
- Factorise simple numbers
- Conduct simple RSA simulations
